building libduplex
==================

Requirements:

* a computer
* a keyboard
* python
* libuuid (if you're on Linux or Mac OS X, that's fine)
  - libuuid either comes from util-linux or e2fsprogs
* libssh
  - must enable server mode
  - we make and handle custom requests, so we need a custom build of
    libssh so that we don't throw the requests away
  - see libssh fork at https://github.com/robxu9/libssh
  - that branch is rebased often from the main libssh git master
* check
  - optional; only if you want to do some unit testing (recommended!)

Building:

We use the waf build system, because it's easier to work with.

Configuring: ./waf configure (gnu options work, see --help)
Building: ./waf build (if you have check, it automatically does testing)
Installing: ./waf install

Debugging:

If you installed libssh to a non-standard directory, it may be helpful to use:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/libssh/lib PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/libssh/lib/pkgconfig
  (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS X)

Add debugging symbols and make all warnings errors:
  CFLAGS="-g -Wall -Werror"

If you want to gdb the unit tests, you'll need the following environment variable:
  CK_FORK=no (in order to prevent check from forking every test)
